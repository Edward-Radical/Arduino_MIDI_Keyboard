# Arduino_MIDI_Keyboard

*(Constantly Updated)*

This project will contain all the steps that you need to built from scratch a fully-functional MIDI musical keyboard based on the Arduino board.

There'll be different folders with step-by-step code for all the different parts that will make up the final project. And at the end a master-code will be uploaded.

For the setup take a look at the SETUP file. It contain the list of materials, how to wire the components to the Arduino and the Arduino to the pc.

## **#First** </br>
Single Button</br>
The first code consist in a simple button that send MIDI messages to the pc through the Arduino Board. 
It's possible to take two roads. The first one which uses the MIDI.h library and the second one which doesn't.
